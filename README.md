Multi-Git Deploy
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EdgeJ/multi_git_deploy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EdgeJ/multi_git_deploy)

Work in progress. This is a web-application tool to manage and simultaneously
merge git repositories via the Gitlab application.  It hooks into the Gitlab
REST API via the Python requests module.

Python 3 is required, as it's about time the Python community ditched 2.7.
